# Tic Tac Toe Game (with Minimax Algorithm)

This is a small project that implements a simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game in C++. The game uses the **Minimax algorithm** to determine the optimal moves for the computer player.

## Features
- Play as 'O' against the computer ('X').
- The computer uses the Minimax algorithm for decision-making.
- The game continues until there's a winner or a draw.

## Purpose
This project was created as a learning exercise for understanding game theory and implementing the Minimax algorithm.

## How to Run the Code

### 1. Compile the Code
Ensure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC) installed. Then, use the following command to compile the code:

```bash
g++ ttt.cpp -o tictactoe

tictactoe.exe #on windows
./tictactoe  #on Mac/linux
```
### 2. Play the Game
Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the computer.

### Reference
This implementation is inspired by the article Finding Optimal Move in Tic Tac Toe using Minimax Algorithm on GeeksforGeeks.
